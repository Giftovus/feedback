Giftovus Beta Testing Support
=========

First off, we'd like to thank you for helping us test our application. We're very excited about our app and what it can do. But, we know that there are things we can do better, and maybe even a bug or two. That's what we'd like your help with!

Our application has been designed to allow people to collaborate on gifts for their friends and family. If you're looking to give a meaningful gift, or share your insights to help others give a better gift, we're the best place to get started.

The app has three main concepts, Groups, Ideas and Options.

  - **Groups** - A group is the community of people creating gift Ideas for a single person.
  - **Ideas** - An Idea is a high level concept for a possible gift - think big concepts like 'shoes', 'a new coat' or 'a game'.
  - **Options** - An Option is a specific product that might fit the Idea being discussed - e.g. products like 'Red size 11.5 Nike Air Jordans', 'Nau Deft Jacket' or 'Madden 2014'.

How to test
-----------

This is what we'd like you to do while testing:

1. Sign up at http://www.giftovus.com/
1. During your first run through of the site, record your thoughts. What was difficult for you to do? What did you think was done well?
1. Create an issue in GitHub [here](https://github.com/Giftovus/feedback/issues/new) and title it, "General Thoughts - Tim", except using your name rather than Tim. Don't use your last name.
1. Create/join a few Groups, Ideas and Options. If you find anything annoying, put it in your General Thoughts issue. You can do this by clicking on your issue and adding a comment.
1. If you find a bug, please create an issue for it. When creating a issue for a bug please be sure to include the following:
  *  The operating system you're using (Mac OS X, Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04).
  *  The browser you're using (Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer 9, Safari).
  *  What you were attempting to do
  *  What you actually happened
  *  A screenshot if you have the time

Have an idea that you think we should implement?
-----------
Create an issue for it and prefix it with "Idea - ", but leave off the quotes.

Again thank you for helping us with testing!
